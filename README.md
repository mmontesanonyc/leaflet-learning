# leaflet-learning
Following along with [MapTiler's Leaflet tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVnimcQsuwk) to learn [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

I want to:
- Create choropleth maps
- Customize tooltips
- Create modular maps with clickables that power some external JS (as in [Realtime AQ](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/realtime/))
- Integrate bar charts (as in, map/bar with mutual hover-highlighting)
